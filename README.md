### Hinge bug

this unity project appears to isolate a bug in scripting hinge joints

walk forward and the targetPosition of the spring changes in the project, but the door does not move.

change that value yourself in the project and it does move.

I'm new to Unity, so perhaps I'm doing this wrong, either show me how to do this right, or it's a bug.  I want to be able to walk forward and have the door swing open.
